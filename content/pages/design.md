### Legibility

- use proper contrast

- choose fonts that are easy to read

- Never use a serif font for the <p>

- people read left to right never center a large chunk of text

- avoid using font-sizes lower than 15px for important text & input text

- on mobile other secondary text can be as small as 13px & 14px

### Visual Hierarchy

  

- Apply contrast between headlines, links & buttons

- most important information is organized by what is most valuable to the user

- always keep the business objective in mind when structuring the homepage

  
  

Don't go font crazy

  

- the general design rule is no more than 3- but for speed purposes try to pick 1-2 fonts

- once you choose the font & it's on the site go through a few pages to make sure it's legible and makes sense with the existing branding

  

Consistency is the key to a users heart

  

- if you do a cool thing- do that cool thing throughout the site

(animations, icon design style, splash of color)

- use the same fonts, colors, design elements, buttons throughout the site

- choose a CTA button and stick with it - other buttons should look differently

- try to stay close to the branding of the company **if they have solid branding

  

Use images that make sense to the user

  

Some options here but use your best judgement:

- use an image from the dealer if they have this option available

- choose a photo of a happy family in their home - pulls at the users’ heartstrings

- choose an image that relates to common problems the user has i.e - wet basement, cracked foundation, ( make sure the headline matches up well with this type of image & that the user can tell what's going on in the photo )

- choose an image that represents finished work the dealer does ( better for roofing dealers, remodeling dealers )

- choose an image that portrays the branding of the company ( great for dealers who have great branding- if they don't do not bother )

- show a before and after shot in the main message - people love a glow up

- choose a photo of people doing the work, talking with homeowners ( photos that instill trust in a brand will work)

### Colors

  

- Do not use too many colors!!!

- Create a color palette that works with their branding ( [https://coolors.co/](https://coolors.co/) or [https://color.adobe.com/create](https://color.adobe.com/create) )

- Try adding color after designing

- Colors convey emotions, keep this in mind when choosing a color scheme for your site

### Alignment & Proportions

There is a nifty little tool that can check to make sure items on the page are aligned

### Mobile

  

- Sometimes it makes sense to design mobile first ( like landing pages )

- the font sizes don't need to be crazy large

- Make sure H1’s/ H2’s do not take up an entire page when scrolling

- hide items you can hide for optimal mobile experience

- make sure buttons are clickable & reachable

- thumb rule

### Research

- it's boring but it's very helpful

- look up nearby competitors, other contractor sites, sites that inspire you, sites with similar color palettes

- look up new design trends and try them out
